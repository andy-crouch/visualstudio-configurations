Visual Studio Configurations
============================

About visualstudio-configurations
---------------------------------

This is a small repo used to contain my customised Visual Studio settings files for each version of Visual Studio that I use.

I was hosting this in my personal DropBox account but as I have been [cleaning up my configuration files] (https://github.com/andy-crouch/dotfiles/) I decided this would be a good time to create this repo.

Each version of Visual Studio has it's own sub-directory and you are more than welcome to use a clone of my settings as a basis for your own configuration.  However, I change things at will to modify my own workflow and will push these changes on a frequent occurrence.

vs2010 Configuration
--------------------

I currently use a very stripped down IDE set-up which runs the [Jellybeans] (http://studiostyl.es/schemes/jellybeans) theme which I have modified to make better (imho!).  A lot of the standard keyboard short cuts have been changed as I use the excellent [VsVim] (http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329) extension to implement Vim key bindings.  If you import my settings it is highly recommended you go through the Keyboard short cuts to see what's changed from the standard configuration.

Apart from the keyboard short cuts my configuration strips Visual Studio right back to one Main tool bar and collapses all of the tool windows.

Any suggestions or comments are always welcome
